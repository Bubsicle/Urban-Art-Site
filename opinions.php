        <p class="align-middle">This urban art would have been a main conversation because it is such as decorated bridge, this made such a tired process a masterpiece that can be walked over. Itâ€™s a center point to stand under and witness a long trail of different colours that lead the eye all the way across. This standardised the communication process and reflects on global interests. I think the message of this is to make simple things much more exciting and always try to think of things like this from a different perspective.</p>

      <p class="align-middle">This piece would bring back old and new memories of comic books and that certain style. People would instantly recognise it and create a sense of wonder for why there is such a familiar thing up-scaled to fit a whole building. I think the message of this piece is to try and think of things in a much larger scale than before and try to understand how it would be if it was bigger than it originally was. Because it is so unusual and such a new style it would add a contemporary feel to the surrounding area.</p>
