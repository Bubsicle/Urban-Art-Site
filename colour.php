        <p class="align-middle">The use of colour in street art is very important because this is one of the first things that catches the viewer's eye. Colour can also be used to lead the viewer's eye around the piece of art. In a lot of street art, a common colour palette is the primary colours and building into the secondary colours and manipulating tonal ranges to adjust a gradient effect. However other examples of using colour  could be when the artist uses one colour and then only uses different shades and tones of that colour to keep a consistent style.</p>
