        <p class="align-middle">The location of the art is one of the most important factors and depending on the location, depends on how impactful street art is. Street art that is a main area, completely open and nothing blocking it, shows its dominance and its true purpose. Also the location of street art can affect where it is made, commonly when it is made on buildings, the buildings value increases dramatically. The more open and loud it is in its position, the more breathtaking it is, because it presents the strength with its message in a powerful way.</p>
