  <p>The culture of urban art shows a way that people can express themselves on a much larger scale to hundreds and thousands of people each day without having to say anything. They can show past experiences, political statements and opinions that may be unpopular or not. Urban art has become so regular to people that it is a tourist sight to others and is a regular experience for others. These two groups have one thing in common though, they all get an anonymous message from the artist. Now urban art constantly conveys emotion and opinions of artists all around the world on a much larger scale.</p>
