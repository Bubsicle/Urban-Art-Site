        <p class="align-middle">Roa made this piece to show a crawl and struggle of these animals and the transition of where animals lived before cities. This could also show a past of that specific area such as how the emotions were displayed before this piece was made and re-invented the area. This also could show the evolution of Malaga and how the animals are crawling and scratching to get a sense of freedom from a dark age in that time period. However it is clear that this age is the result of this hard work and struggle.</p>

      <p class="align-middle">This street art shows a phase in the time period when street art started to develop the surroundings and changing it into an area that can be well respected and it’s message is conveying that the time they are living in today does not resemble an old tired area, but a new redesigned and stylish area that can be respected even when it’s canvas is a old run down building, pulling out the beauty in old things.</p>
