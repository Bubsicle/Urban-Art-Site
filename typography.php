        <p class="align-middle">Typography is used by street artists to convey a message in a straightforward way, although typography can be used to introduce many interesting visuals that can show a 3D effect or a very abstract style. This allows the artist to also experiment with different colour palettes, the text tends to be a bold font to make a large impact on the viewer and assist in conveying the message. Text can be morphed to merge into the background in a sort of illusion style or contrast against the background and be loud and obvious.</p>
